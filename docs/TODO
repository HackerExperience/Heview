Custom scroll:

Due to browser inconsistencies and lack of proper support, we should create our own scrolling mechanism in order to have full control over its design.

How to:

1 - Hide native scrollbar (it still scrolls, it's just hidden)
2 - Add our own div on its place
3 - Calculate scroll based on div size and current view X Y
4 - Change our scroll's marker based on value from 3
5 - Listen to `on-scroll`
6 - Detect `on-mouse-down` on div, and based on mouse position use JS's `scrollTo`
